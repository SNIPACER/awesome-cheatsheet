## Debugging

**The Sources panel has 3 parts:**

1. The **File Navigator pane** lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
1. The **Code Editor** pane shows the source code.
2. The **JavaScript Debugging pane** is for debugging, we’ll explore it soon.

## Breakpoint

1. A *breakpoint* is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.
   1. <img src="./assets/breakpoints.png" width="700" />
   2. We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That’s useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to:
      1. Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on it in the right panel).
      2. Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.
      3. Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.
      4. …And so on.
         1. **Conditional breakpoints**
            1. *Right click* on the line number allows to create a *conditional* breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression, that you should provide when you create it, is truthy.
            2. That’s handy when we need to stop only for a certain variable value or for certain function parameters.

1. **Resume**: continue the execution, hotkey <kbd class="shortcut">F8</kbd>.
2. **Step**: run the next command, hotkey <kbd class="shortcut">F9</kbd>.
3. **Step over**: run the next command, but *don’t go into a function*, hotkey <kbd class="shortcut">F10</kbd>.
4. **Step into**: goes into their code, waiting for them if necessary, like in *async* functions<kbd class="shortcut">F11</kbd>.
5. **Step out**: continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey <kbd class="shortcut">Shift+F11</kbd>.
6.  **Logging**: To output something to console from our code, there’s `console.log` function.
    - ```js
      // open console to see
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log("value,", i);
      }
      ```

### The command "debugger"

> We can also pause the code by using the `debugger` command in it, like this:

- ```js
  function hello(name) {
    let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;

    debugger;  // <-- the debugger stops here

    say(phrase);
  }
  ```
- <img src="./assets/debugging_pane.png" width="700" />


1. **`Watch`** – **shows current values for any expressions.**
   1. You can click the plus `+` and input an expression. The debugger will show its value, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.

2. **`Call Stack`** – **shows the nested calls chain.**
   1. At the current moment the debugger is inside `hello()` call, called by a script in `index.html` (no function there, so it’s called “anonymous”).
   2. If you click on a stack item (e.g. “anonymous”), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, and all its variables can be examined as well.

3.  **`Scope`**– **current variables.**
    1.  Local shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.
    2.  Global has global variables (out of any functions).

> **Continue to here**
> Right click on a line of code opens the context menu with a great option called “Continue to here”.
> 
> That’s handy when we want to move multiple steps forward to the line, but we’re too lazy to set a breakpoint.

## Styling

[Google Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

## Automated Linters

**Linters are tools that can automatically check the style of your code and make improving suggestions.**

The great thing about them is that style-checking can also find some bugs, like typos in variable or function names. Because of this feature, using a linter is recommended even if you don’t want to stick to one particular “code style”.

Here are some well-known linting tools:

1. **JSLint** – one of the first linters.
1. **JSHint** – more settings than JSLint.
1. **ESLint** – probably the newest one.

All of them can do the job. The author uses [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/).
