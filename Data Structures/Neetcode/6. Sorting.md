Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and are used to rearrange elements in a specific order. Let's discuss some common sorting algorithms, their characteristics, and when to use them:

### 1. Bubble Sort:

- **Description**: Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) in the worst and average cases, \(O(n)\) in the best case (when the list is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\).
- **When to Use**: Bubble sort is simple to implement but inefficient on large lists. It is suitable for educational purposes or small datasets.
- Visual representaion
  ```less
    Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] -> [3, 5, 1, 4, 8]
    Pass 2: [3, 5, 1, 4, 8] -> [3, 1, 4, 5, 8]
    Pass 3: [3, 1, 4, 5, 8] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
    Pass 4: [1, 3, 4, 5, 8] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

### 2. Selection Sort:

- **Description**: Selection sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) in all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\).
- **When to Use**: Selection sort is simple and easy to understand. It performs well on small lists but is inefficient for large datasets.
- Visual representaion
  ```less
  Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] -> [1, 3, 8, 5, 4]
  Pass 2: [1, 3, 8, 5, 4] -> [1, 3, 8, 5, 4]
  Pass 3: [1, 3, 8, 5, 4] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  Pass 4: [1, 3, 4, 5, 8] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

### 3. Insertion Sort:

- **Description**: Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly removing elements from the input data and inserting them into the correct position in the sorted array.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) in the worst and average cases, \(O(n)\) in the best case (when the list is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\).
- **When to Use**: Insertion sort is efficient for sorting small arrays or nearly sorted arrays.
- Visual representaion
  ```less
  Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] -> [3, 5, 8, 1, 4]
  Pass 2: [3, 5, 8, 1, 4] -> [3, 5, 8, 1, 4]
  Pass 3: [3, 5, 8, 1, 4] -> [1, 3, 5, 8, 4]
  Pass 4: [1, 3, 5, 8, 4] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

### 4. Merge Sort:

- **Description**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) in all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) auxiliary space.
- **When to Use**: Merge sort is efficient for sorting large datasets and is stable (maintains the order of equal elements).
- Visual representaion
  ```less
    [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] -> [5, 3, 8], [1, 4]
    [5, 3, 8] -> [5], [3, 8]
    [3, 8] -> [3], [8]
    Merge: [3], [8] -> [3, 8]
    Merge: [5], [3, 8] -> [3, 5, 8]
    [1, 4] -> [1], [4]
    Merge: [1], [4] -> [1, 4]
    Merge: [3, 5, 8], [1, 4] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]    
  ```

### 5. Quick Sort:

- **Description**: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a "pivot" element and partitions the list into two sublists, one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sublists.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) in the average and best cases, \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case (rare).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\) auxiliary space.
- **When to Use**: Quick sort is efficient for sorting large datasets and is often used in practice due to its average-case time complexity.
- Visual representaion
  ```less
    [5, 3, 8, 1, 4]
    Pivot: 4
    Less than Pivot: [3, 1], Pivot: [4], Greater than Pivot: [5, 8]
    Pivot: 1
    Less than Pivot: [], Pivot: [1], Greater than Pivot: [3]
    Pivot: 8
    Less than Pivot: [5], Pivot: [8], Greater than Pivot: []
    [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]

  ```

### 6. Heap Sort:

- **Description**: Heap sort builds a binary heap from the input list and repeatedly extracts the maximum (for a max heap) or minimum (for a min heap) element from the heap until it is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) in all cases.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\).
- **When to Use**: Heap sort is efficient for sorting large datasets and has a guaranteed \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity.
- Visual representaion
  ```less
    Pass 1: [5, 3, 8, 1, 4] -> [3, 5, 1, 4, 8]
    Pass 2: [3, 5, 1, 4, 8] -> [3, 1, 4, 5, 8]
    Pass 3: [3, 1, 4, 5, 8] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
    Pass 4: [1, 3, 4, 5, 8] -> [1, 3, 4, 5, 8]
  ```

Each sorting algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of algorithm depends on factors such as the size of the dataset, the nature of the data, and the desired performance characteristics. It's essential to understand these algorithms and their properties to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario.
