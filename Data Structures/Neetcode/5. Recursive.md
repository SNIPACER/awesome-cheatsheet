Sure! Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. Let's explore how recursion works with the example of calculating the factorial of a number.

### Factorial Function

The factorial of a non-negative integer \( n \), denoted as \( n! \), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( n \). Mathematically, it is defined as:

\[ n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \ldots \times 2 \times 1 \]

For example:
- \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \)
- \( 0! = 1 \)

### Recursive Approach

The factorial of \( n \) can be computed recursively using the following steps:

1. If \( n = 0 \), return 1 (base case).
2. Otherwise, return \( n \times \text{factorial}(n-1) \).

### Implementation in Java

Here's how you can implement the factorial function recursively in Java:

```java
public class Factorial {
    public static int factorial(int n) {
        // Base case: if n is 0, return 1
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        // Recursive case: return n * factorial(n - 1)
        else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + n + " is: " + factorial(n));
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the factorial function is \( O(n) \) because the function makes \( n \) recursive calls, each taking constant time.

The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the space required for the call stack during recursion. In each recursive call, the function's state (including the parameter \( n \)) is stored on the call stack until the base case is reached.

### Example Execution

Let's see how the factorial function works for \( n = 5 \):

```
factorial(5)
5 * factorial(4)
    4 * factorial(3)
        3 * factorial(2)
            2 * factorial(1)
                1 * factorial(0)
                    return 1 (base case)
                return 1 * 1
            return 2 * 1
        return 3 * 2
    return 4 * 6
return 5 * 24
```

So, \( 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \).

Recursion can be a powerful tool for solving problems that exhibit recursive properties, like factorial computation. However, it's important to ensure that the base case is well-defined to prevent infinite recursion. Let me know if you need further explanation or assistance!

# Fibonacci Series

Certainly! Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are computed as follows:

\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]

where \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \).

### Recursive Approach

The Fibonacci sequence can be computed recursively using the following steps:

1. If \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \), return \( n \) (base case).
2. Otherwise, return \( \text{fib}(n-1) + \text{fib}(n-2) \).

### Implementation in Java

Here's how you can implement the Fibonacci sequence recursively in Java:

```java
public class Fibonacci {
    public static int fib(int n) {
        // Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n
        if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n;
        }
        // Recursive case: return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
        else {
            return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println("Fibonacci of " + n + " is: " + fib(n));
    }
}
```

### Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of the Fibonacci function is \( O(2^n) \) because the function makes two recursive calls in each step, resulting in an exponential time complexity.

The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) due to the space required for the call stack during recursion. In each recursive call, the function's state (including the parameter \( n \)) is stored on the call stack until the base case is reached.

### Example Execution

Let's see how the Fibonacci function works for \( n = 5 \):

```
fib(5)
fib(4) + fib(3)
fib(3) + fib(2) + fib(2) + fib(1)
fib(2) + fib(1) + fib(1) + fib(0) + fib(1) + fib(0) + 1 + 0 + 1
1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1
5
```

So, \( F(5) = 5 \).

While the recursive approach to computing the Fibonacci sequence is simple, it is not efficient for large values of \( n \) due to the exponential time complexity. Other approaches, such as dynamic programming or iterative solutions, are more suitable for larger inputs. Let me know if you need further explanation or assistance!
