# 1.  Binary Search

**Description**: Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the search continues in the lower half, or if it is greater, it continues in the upper half. This process continues until the item is found or the interval is empty.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with the middle element of the sorted array.
2. If the target value is equal to the middle element, return the index.
3. If the target value is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half.
4. If the target value is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half.
5. Repeat the steps until the target value is found or the subarray has no elements.

## Binary Search Implementation in Java

```java
public class BinarySearch {

    // Binary search function
    public static int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            // Check if target is present at mid
            if (arr[mid] == target) {
                return mid; // Target found
            }
            // If target is greater, ignore left half
            if (arr[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            // If target is smaller, ignore right half
            else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // Target is not present in array
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19};
        int target = 7;
        int result = binarySearch(arr, target);
        
        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Element not present in array");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Element found at index: " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: \(O(1)\) (when the middle element is the target)
- **Average and Worst Case**: \(O(\log n)\) (where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array)

### Space Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for iterative implementation (constant space usage)

### Visual Representation

Let's consider an example array and a target value to understand how binary search works visually.

**Example**:
```
Array: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
Target: 7
```

1. **Initial State**:
   ```
   [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
             ^
          (mid = 9)
   ```
   Target (7) < mid (9), search in the left half.

2. **Left Half**:
   ```
   [1, 3, 5, 7]
          ^
       (mid = 5)
   ```
   Target (7) > mid (5), search in the right half.

3. **Right Half**:
   ```
   [7]
      ^
   (mid = 7)
   ```
   Target (7) == mid (7), target found at index 3.

**Summary**:
Binary search efficiently narrows down the search space by halving the interval at each step, making it significantly faster than linear search for large, sorted arrays. However, it requires the array to be sorted beforehand.

# 2. Binary Search to Find the Range (Search Range)

In some cases, we need to find the range (start and end indices) of a target value in a sorted array that may contain duplicate elements.

#### Example
Given array: `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]`
Target: `8`

**Steps**:
1. **Find the leftmost (first) occurrence of the target**.
2. **Find the rightmost (last) occurrence of the target**.

### **Visual Representation**:
```vbnet
Array: [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
Target: 8

Step 1: Find leftmost occurrence of 8
[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
          ^
       (mid = 7)
Target (8) > mid (7), search in the right half.

[8, 8, 10]
      ^
   (mid = 8)
Leftmost occurrence of 8 found at index 3.

Step 2: Find rightmost occurrence of 8
[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
              ^
           (mid = 8)
Target (8) == mid (8), search in the right half for last occurrence.

[8, 10]
      ^
   (mid = 8)
Rightmost occurrence of 8 found at index 4.

Result: Range [3, 4]
```

## Java Implementation of Search Range

```java
public class SearchRange {

    public static int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        result[0] = findFirst(nums, target);
        result[1] = findLast(nums, target);
        return result;
    }

    private static int findFirst(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int index = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] >= target) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            if (nums[mid] == target) index = mid;
        }
        return index;
    }

    private static int findLast(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int index = -1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] <= target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
            if (nums[mid] == target) index = mid;
        }
        return index;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10};
        int target = 8;
        int[] range = searchRange(nums, target);
        
        System.out.println("Start index: " + range[0]);
        System.out.println("End index: " + range[1]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding an Element**: \(O(\log n)\)
- **Finding the Range**: \(O(\log n)\) for each of the two searches, so overall \(O(\log n) + O(\log n) = O(\log n)\)

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for both operations as no additional space is used other than variables.

### Summary
Binary search and its variants are powerful techniques for searching in sorted arrays. They are efficient with a logarithmic time complexity, making them suitable for large datasets. Understanding these variations and knowing when to use them can significantly improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills.
