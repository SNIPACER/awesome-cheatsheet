**1. Professional Communication:**

   **What to Speak:**

   - **Use clear and simple language:**
     - *Example:* Instead of saying, "I'm having difficulty comprehending the intricacies of the code," you could say, "I'm having trouble understanding some parts of the code. Can you help explain them?"

   - **Ask questions if you don't understand something:**
     - *Example:* "I'm not quite sure about how this feature is supposed to work. Could you please clarify the expected outcome?"

   - **Share your ideas and thoughts respectfully:**
     - *Example:* Instead of saying, "I think that idea is not good," you could say, "I appreciate your suggestion, but I have a different perspective. What if we consider this alternative approach?"


**2. Team Collaboration:**

   **What to Do:**

   - **Collaborate with team members on projects:**
     - *Example:* Actively participate in team meetings, share updates, and contribute ideas. If you see a team member facing challenges, offer your assistance.

   - **Share your knowledge and learn from others:**
     - *Example:* If you discover a helpful resource or technique, share it with your team. At the same time, be open to learning from your colleagues' experiences and expertise.

   - **Offer help and support when needed:**
     - *Example:* If a team member seems overwhelmed with tasks, you can say, "I noticed you have a lot on your plate. Is there anything I can help you with or take off your hands?"


**3. Project Assignments:**

   **What to Do:**

   - **Understand the project requirements and goals:**
     - *Example:* Before starting a project, thoroughly read the project brief and make a list of key requirements. If there are unclear points, seek clarification from project stakeholders.

   - **Break down tasks into manageable parts:**
     - *Example:* Instead of tackling a project as a whole, break it down into smaller tasks or milestones. For instance, if developing a new feature, start with understanding requirements, then move on to coding, testing, and implementation.

   - **Communicate progress regularly:**
     - *Example:* Provide regular updates during team meetings or through project management tools. For example, "I've completed the initial phase of coding and will be moving on to testing by the end of the week."


**4. Time Management:**

   **What to Do:**

   - **Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and importance:**
     - *Example:* Use a task management tool to organize your tasks. Identify urgent tasks with approaching deadlines and prioritize them. For instance, if you have a bug that needs fixing, prioritize it over a less critical feature development task.

   - **Use calendars or planners to keep track of deadlines:**
     - *Example:* Utilize a shared calendar to mark project milestones and deadlines. Regularly update your personal calendar or planner to stay organized and ensure you meet all deadlines.

   - **Inform your team if you encounter any challenges:**
     - *Example:* If you foresee challenges in meeting a deadline, communicate with your team as early as possible. For example, "I'm facing unexpected issues with this task and might need an extra day to ensure quality work. Is that acceptable?"


**5. Professional Etiquette:**

   **What to Do:**

   - **Dress appropriately for the workplace:**
     - *Example:* Follow the dress code guidelines of your workplace. If it's a business-casual environment, wear neat and clean attire. If in doubt, it's better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.

   - **Be punctual for meetings and deadlines:**
     - *Example:* Arrive on time for meetings and ensure that you submit your work before the deadline. Being punctual shows respect for others' time and contributes to a positive work environment.

   - **Respect others' workspace and privacy:**
     - *Example:* Avoid disturbing your colleagues unnecessarily. If you need to discuss something, send a quick message or ask if it's a convenient time. Respect the boundaries of personal workspace.
