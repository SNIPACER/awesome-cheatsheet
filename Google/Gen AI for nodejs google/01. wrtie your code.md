## Prerequisites

1. If you do not already have a Google account, you must create a Google account.
- Use a personal account instead of a work or school account. Work and school accounts may have restrictions that prevent you from enabling the APIs needed for this lab.
2. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you must create a GitHub account
- Use an existing GitHub account if you have one. GitHub is more likely to block a new account as spam.
- Configure two-factor authentication on your GitHub account to reduce the chances of your account being marked as spam.
