6. Summary

## 1. Cloud computing

- The US National Institute of Standards and Technology created the term cloud computing,

Cloud computing is a way of using information technology that has these **five equally** important traits.

1. Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service .
2. Customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere.
3. The provider of those resources allocates them to users out of that pool.
4. The resources are elastic-which means they can increase or decrease as needed
5. Customers pay only for what they use, or resources as they go.

## 2. Cloud vs Traditional architecture

1. **First wave** Colocation gave users the financial efficiency of renting physical space, instead of investing in data center real estate.
2. **Second wave** Virtualized data centers of today, which is the second wave, share similarities with the private data centers and colocation facilities of decades past.
  - The components of virtualized data centers match the physical building blocks of hosted computing—servers, CPUs, disks, load balancers, and so on—but now they’re virtual devices.
3. **Third wave** Several years ago, Google realized that its business couldn’t move fast enough within the confines of the virtualization model.
  - So Google switched to a container-based architecture—a fully automated, elastic third-wave cloud that consists of a combination of automated services and scalable data.

- Google cloud data centers consume 2% of world electricity.
- The data center cooling system in Finland is the first of its kind anywhere in the world.
  - Google's data center, Hamina, Finland
  

## 3. IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

Cloud services offering are
  - **IaaS** : Infrastructure as a Service
    - Raw compute
    - Storage
    - Network capabilities
  - **PaaS** : Platform as a Service 
    - PaaS offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure applications need.
    - This allows more resources to be focused on application logic.

> `IaaS` - Pay what they allocate and `PaaS` - Pay what they use.

### Serverless computing

- Serverless is yet another step in the evolution of cloud computing.
- Serverless computing allows
  - developers to concentrate on their code,
  - No need server configuration, by eliminating the need for any infrastructure management.

- Serverless technologies offered by Google include
  - **Cloud Functions**: which manages event-driven code as a pay-as-you-go service,
  - **Cloud Run**: which allows customers to deploy their containerized microservices–based application in a fully managed environment.


### SaaS

- SaaS applications are not installed on your local computer.
- They run in the cloud as a service and are consumed directly over the internet by end users.

> Google's popular applications like `Gmail`, `Docs`, and `Drive`, collectively known as `Google Workspace`, are all classified as `SaaS`.
