# LAB - Google Kubernetes Engine: Qwik Start

- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure.
- The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically [Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) instances) grouped to form a [container cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-architecture).

## Cluster orchestration with Google Kubernetes Engine
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters are powered by the Kubernetes open source cluster management system. Kubernetes provides the mechanisms through which you interact with your container cluster.
- You use Kubernetes commands and resources to deploy and manage your applications, perform administrative tasks, set policies, and monitor the health of your deployed workloads.
- Kubernetes draws on the same design principles that run popular Google services and provides the same benefits: automatic management, monitoring and liveness probes for application containers, automatic scaling, rolling updates, and more.
- When you run your applications on a container cluster, you're using technology based on Google's 10+ years of experience with running production workloads in containers.

## Kubernetes on Google Cloud

- When you run a GKE cluster, you also gain the benefit of advanced cluster management features that Google Cloud provides. These include:

- [**Load balancing**](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing-and-autoscaling) for Compute Engine instances
- [**Node pools**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-pools) to designate subsets of nodes within a cluster for additional flexibility
- [**Automatic scaling**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/cluster-autoscaler) of your cluster's node instance count
- [**Automatic upgrades**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/node-auto-upgrade) for your cluster's node software
- [**Node auto-repair**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair) to maintain node health and availability
- [**Logging and Monitoring**](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-repair) with Cloud Monitoring for visibility into your cluster



# Cloud Run - Manage serverless computing with cloud run

- A fully managed serverless platform for developing and deploying scalable containerized applications.

## Cloud Run is managed serverless computing

- A managed compute platform that can run stateless containers
- Serverless, removing the need for infrastructure management
- Built on Knative, an open API and runtime environment built on Kubernetes
- Can automatically scale up and down from zero almost instantaneously, charging only for the resources used
