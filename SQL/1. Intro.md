# SQL

## SQL Definition

This course is done on under the guidance of ChatGPT.

Sure! I'll guide you through SQL from the basics to more advanced topics. We'll start with fundamental concepts and gradually build up to more complex queries and operations.

## Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate databases. It allows you to perform various operations on the data stored in a relational database.

### Basic Concepts
- **Database**: A collection of organized data.
- **Table**: A collection of related data entries consisting of rows and columns.
- **Row**: A single record in a table.
- **Column**: A set of data values of a particular type, one for each row in the table.

## Basic SQL Operations

### 1. Creating a Table
To create a new table in a database, use the `CREATE TABLE` statement.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    roll_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(255),
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    age INT
);
```
### 2. Inserting Data
To insert data into a table, use the `INSERT INTO` statement.
```sql
INSERT INTO Student (roll_no, name, address, phone, age)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '123 Main St', '555-1234', 20);
```

### 3. Querying Data
To retrieve data from a table, use the `SELECT` statement.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Student;
```
To select specific columns:
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM Student;
```

### 4. Updating Data
To update existing data in a table, use the `UPDATE` statement.
```sql
UPDATE Student
SET address = '456 Elm St', phone = '555-5678'
WHERE roll_no = 1;
```

### 5. Deleting Data
To delete data from a table, use the `DELETE FROM` statement.
```sql
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE roll_no = 1;
```

## Intermediate SQL Operations

### 1. Filtering Data
To filter data, use the `WHERE` clause.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE age > 20;
```
### 2. Sorting Data
To sort data, use the `ORDER BY` clause.
```sql
SELECT * FROM Student
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

### 3. Joining Tables
To retrieve data from multiple tables, use `JOIN` operations.
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
```sql
SELECT s.roll_no, s.name, sc.course_id
FROM Student s
INNER JOIN StudentCourse sc ON s.roll_no = sc.roll_no;
```
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
```sql
SELECT s.roll_no, s.name, sc.course_id
FROM Student s
LEFT JOIN StudentCourse sc ON s.roll_no = sc.roll_no;
```
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
```sql
SELECT s.roll_no, s.name, sc.course_id
FROM Student s
RIGHT JOIN StudentCourse sc ON s.roll_no = sc.roll_no;
```
- **FULL JOIN**: Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. If no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
```sql
SELECT s.roll_no, s.name, sc.course_id
FROM Student s
FULL OUTER JOIN StudentCourse sc ON s.roll_no = sc.roll_no;
```

### 4. Grouping Data
To group data, use the `GROUP BY` clause.
```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS number_of_students
FROM Student
GROUP BY age;
```
To filter groups, use the `HAVING` clause.
```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*) AS number_of_students
FROM Student
GROUP BY age
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Advanced SQL Operations

### 1. Subqueries
A subquery is a query within another query.
```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM Student
WHERE roll_no IN (SELECT roll_no FROM StudentCourse WHERE course_id = 101);
```

### 2. Window Functions
Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
```sql
SELECT name, age, 
       AVG(age) OVER (PARTITION BY age) AS average_age
FROM Student;
```

### 3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
A CTE is a temporary result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
```sql
WITH OlderStudents AS (
    SELECT * FROM Student WHERE age > 20
)
SELECT * FROM OlderStudents;
```

### 4. Indexing
Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table.
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_student_name ON Student(name);
```

### 5. Transactions
Transactions are used to ensure data integrity. They allow multiple SQL statements to be executed as a single unit of work.
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE Student SET age = age + 1 WHERE roll_no = 1;
UPDATE Student SET age = age + 1 WHERE roll_no = 2;
COMMIT;
```
If something goes wrong, you can `ROLLBACK` the transaction to its previous state.
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

### COUNT() Function

- The `COUNT()` function is an aggregate function in SQL that **returns the number of rows** that match a specified **condition**.
- It is commonly used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in a column or set of columns.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example Usage
Let's look at a table `Student`:

| roll_no | name      | age | course_id |
|---------|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 1       | John Doe  | 20  | 101       |
| 2       | Jane Smith| 22  | 102       |
| 3       | Sam Brown | 20  | 101       |
| 4       | Lisa White| 23  | 103       |
| 5       | Tom Black | 22  | 101       |

#### Counting Total Rows
To count the total number of rows in the `Student` table:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM Student;
```
Output:
| total_students |
|----------------|
| 5              |

#### Counting Non-NULL Values
To count the number of non-NULL values in a specific column:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(course_id) AS enrolled_students
FROM Student;
```
Output:
| enrolled_students |
|-------------------|
| 5                 |

#### Using COUNT() with GROUP BY
To count the number of students in each course:
```sql
SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS number_of_students
FROM Student
GROUP BY course_id;
```
Output:
| course_id | number_of_students |
|-----------|--------------------|
| 101       | 3                  |
| 102       | 1                  |
| 103       | 1                  |

### Why Use COUNT()?
- **Data Aggregation**: `COUNT()` helps to aggregate data by counting occurrences, which is useful for generating reports and summaries.
- **Identifying Patterns**: It helps identify patterns and trends in data, such as the number of students enrolled in each course.

### What If You Don't Use COUNT()?
If you don't use `COUNT()` when needed, you won't be able to quantify the data. For example, if you want to know how many students are enrolled in each course but don't use `COUNT()`, you'll only get a list of courses without any numbers.

### Related Aggregate Functions
- **SUM()**: Adds up all the values in a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(age) AS total_age
  FROM Student;
  ```
- **AVG()**: Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
  ```sql
  SELECT AVG(age) AS average_age
  FROM Student;
  ```
- **MIN()**: Returns the minimum value in a column.
  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(age) AS youngest_student
  FROM Student;
  ```
- **MAX()**: Returns the maximum value in a column.
  ```sql
  SELECT MAX(age) AS oldest_student
  FROM Student;
  ```

### Practical Exercises

1. **Total Students**: Count the total number of students in the `Student` table.
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
   FROM Student;
   ```

2. **Students Per Course**: Count the number of students enrolled in each course.
   ```sql
   SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS number_of_students
   FROM Student
   GROUP BY course_id;
   ```

3. **Students Above a Certain Age**: Count the number of students above the age of 21.
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS students_above_21
   FROM Student
   WHERE age > 21;
   ```

4. **Courses with More Than One Student**: Find courses that have more than one student enrolled.
   ```sql
   SELECT course_id, COUNT(*) AS number_of_students
   FROM Student
   GROUP BY course_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

By understanding and using the `COUNT()` function and related aggregate functions, you can perform various data analysis tasks in SQL, making your queries more powerful and insightful.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a new table for courses with columns: course_id, course_name, and credits.
2. Insert some sample data into the courses table.
3. Write a query to find all students enrolled in a specific course.
4. Write a query to list all students and their courses, including students who are not enrolled in any courses.
5. Write a query to update a student's address and phone number.
6. Write a query to delete a student from the database.

This should give you a solid foundation in SQL from basics to advanced topics. As you practice and work with SQL more, you'll become more proficient in writing and optimizing queries.
