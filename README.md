Hi @Furqan

As we discussed today, to create a Local SPA using React & fetch the Account Details from Salesforce.
  1. Creating an Custom Object of Features and Achievements, each contains a field of Name and description.
  2. Create an API End point from Salesforce to fetch these data.
  3. Create a SPA and add functionality in that, where we have Account search option.
      a. In Account search component, search an Account name and get the all records related to that name. Based on the clicking on the account name, get the contact details of that particular account name.
      b. In another section of page, show the features and Achievements record Details on page based on the Objects records details. If we update the details on Salesforce, it should also update on the Page.

So @Furqan Please Give me time to work on this task, parallelly working on @Nikhil task.
