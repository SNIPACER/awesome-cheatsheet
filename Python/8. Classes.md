# Python Classes

- A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.
- Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made.
- Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.
- Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

- To understand the need for creating a class in Python.
- let’s consider an example:
  - let’s say you wanted to track the number of `dogs` that may have different **attributes** like *breed*, *age*.
  - If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age.
  - Let’s suppose there are **100** different `dogs`, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs?
  - This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes.

## Class syntax

```py
class ClassName:
# Statement

  # Object Definiation Syntax:
  obj = ClassName()
  print(obj.atrr)
```

- Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.
- A class is like a blueprint for an object

**Some points on Python class:**
1. Classes are created by keyword class.
2. Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
3. Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator.
   1. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute
   2. ```py
      class Dog:
        pass
      ```

## Class Objects

- An `Object` is an instance of a **Class**. A **class** is like a *blueprint* while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.
- It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an **actual** dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old.
- You can have many dogs to create many different **instances**, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.
- Object consist of:
  1. **State**: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
  2. **Behavior**: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
  3. **Identity**: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
|   Identity  |    State/attributes   |       Behaviour      |
|:-----------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Name of dog | Breed<br>Age<br>color | Bark<br>Sleep<br>Eat |

## Declaring Objects (Also called instantiating a class

- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be **instantiated**.
- All the instances **share** the **attributes** and the **behavior** of the `class`.
- But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.

```py
# Declaring an object

class Dog:
  # attribute
  attr1 = "mammal"
  attr2 = "dog"

  # A sample method
  def fun(self):
    print("I'm a", self.attr1)
    print("I'm a", self.attr2)
  
  # Driver code Object instantiation
  Rodger = Dog()

  # Accessing class attributes and method through objects
  print(Rodger.attr1)
  Rodger.fun()

"""
Output:

mammal
I'm a mammal
I'm a dog
"""
```

## The self

- `Class` methods must have an extra *first parameter* in the method definition.
- We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.
- If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.
- This is similar to this `pointer` in C++ and `this` reference in Java.
- When we call a method of this object as `myobject.method(arg1, arg2)`, this is automatically converted by Python into `MyClass.method(myobject, arg1, arg2)` – this is all the special `self` is about.

## __init__ method

- The `__init__` method is similar to constructors in **C++** and **Java**.
- Constructors are used to initializing the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation.
- It runs as soon as an object of a class is **instantiated**. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.
- ```py
  class Person:

    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, name):
      self.name = name

    # Sample Method
    def say_hi(self):
      print('Hello, my name is', self.name)
  
    p = Person('Nikhil')
    p.say_hi()
    """
    Output:
    Hello, my name is Nikhil
    """
  ```

## Class and Instance Variables

- Instance variables are for data, unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class.
- Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class.

### 1. **Defining instance variables using a constructor**

- ```py
  class Dog:

    # Class Variable
    animal = 'dog'

    # The init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, breed, color):
      # Instance Variable
      self.breed = breed
      self.color = color
    
    # Objects of Dog class
    Rodger = Dog("Pug", "brown")
    Buzo = Dog("Bulldog", "black")

    print('Rodger details:')
    print('Rodger is a', Rodger.animal)
    print('Breed: ', Rodger.breed)
    print('Color: ', Rodger.color)

    print('\nBuzo details:')
    print('Buzo is a', Buzo.animal)
    print('Breed: ', Buzo.breed)
    print('Color: ', Buzo.color)

    # Class variables can be accessed using class
    # name also
    print("\nAccessing class variable using class name")
    print(Dog.animal)

    """
    Output:

    Rodger details:
    Rodger is a dog
    Breed: Pug
    Color: brown

    Buzo details:
    Buzo is a dog
    Breed: Bulldog
    Color: black

    Accessing class variable using class name
    dog
    """
  ```

### 2. Defining instance variables using the normal method.

```py
class Dog:
  # Class Variable
  animal = 'dog'

  # The init method or constructor
  def __init__(self, breed):
    # Instance Variable
    self.breed = breed
  
  # Adds an instance variable
  def setColor(self, color):
    self.color =  color

  # Retrieves instance variable
  def getColor(self):
    return self.color
  
  # Driver Code
  Rodger = Dog("pug")
  Rodger.setColor("brown")
  print(Rodger.getColor())

  """
  Output:
  brown
  """
```
