## Input

- To take **input from the user** we make use of a built-in function `input()`.

```py
# input
input1 = input()

# output
print(input1)
```

### Input Typecasting ()int/float)

- **Typecasting the input to Integer:** There might be conditions when you might require integer input from user/Console, the following code takes two `input(integer/float)` from console and typecasts them to integer then prints the sum.
    - ```py
      # input
      num1 = int(input())
      num2 = int(input())
      # printing the sum in integer
      print(num1 + num2)

      #Typecasting the input to Float:
      #-----------------------------
      num1 = float(input())             # input
      num2 = float(input())

      # printing the sum in float
      print(num1 + num2)
      
      # Typecasting the input to String
      #-----------------------------
      string = str(input())             # input
      # output
      print(string)
      ```

## Type Conversion 

- Type conversion functions to directly convert one data type to another data type.
  1. Implicit Type Conversion
  2. Explicit Type Conversion

### 1. Implicit Type

-  The Python interpreter **automatically** converts one *data* type to *another* **without** any **user** involvement.
   -  ```py
      x = 10
      print("x is of type:",type(x))      # <class 'int'>
      y = 10.6
      print("y is of type:",type(y))      # <class 'float'>
      z = x + y
      print(z)                            # 20.6
      print("z is of type:",type(z))      # <class 'float'>
      ```
  - As we can see the data type of `'z'` got automatically changed to the `float` type while one variable x is of integer type while the other variable y is of float type.

### 2. Explicit Type Conversion

- The data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement.
- With explicit type conversion, there is a **risk of data loss** since we are forcing an expression to be changed in some specific data type.
    1. **int(a, base)**: This function converts **any data type** to **integer**. `Base` specifies the base **in which string is** if the data type is a string.
    2. **float()**: This function is used to convert any data type to a floating-point number.
    - ```py
      # Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
      # using int(), float()

      # initializing string
      s = "10010"

      # printing string converting to int base 2
      c = int(s,2)
      # The second argument 2 specifies that the string is in base 2 (binary).
      print ("After converting to integer base 2 : ", end="")
      print (c)

      # printing string converting to float
      e = float(s)
      print ("After converting to float : ", end="")
      print (e)


      # OUTPUT
      #--------------------
      # After converting to integer base 2 : 18   <----- In binary, 10010 is equivalent to 18 in decimal.
      # After converting to float : 10010.0
      ```
    3. **ord()** : This function is used to convert a character to integer.
    4. **hex()** : This function is to convert integer to hexadecimal string.
    5. **oct()** : This function is to convert integer to octal string.
    - ```py
      # Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
      # using  ord(), hex(), oct()

      # initializing integer
      s = '4'

      # printing character converting to integer
      c = ord(s)
      print ("After converting character to integer : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing integer converting to hexadecimal string
      c = hex(56)
      print ("After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing integer converting to octal string
      c = oct(56)
      print ("After converting 56 to octal string : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # Output: 
      #------------------------------------------
      # After converting character to integer : 52
      # After converting 56 to hexadecimal string : 0x38
      # After converting 56 to octal string : 0o70
      ```
    6. **tuple()** : This function is used to convert to a tuple.
    7. **set()** : This function returns the type after converting to set.
    8. **list()** : This function is used to convert any data type to a list type.
    - ```py
      # Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
      # using  tuple(), set(), list()

      # initializing string
      s = 'geeks'

      # printing string converting to tuple
      c = tuple(s)
      print ("After converting string to tuple : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing string converting to set
      c = set(s)
      print ("After converting string to set : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing string converting to list
      c = list(s)
      print ("After converting string to list : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # OUTPUT
      #------------------------------------------
      # After converting string to tuple : ('g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's')
      # After converting string to set : {'k', 'e', 's', 'g'}
      # After converting string to list : ['g', 'e', 'e', 'k', 's']
      ```
    9. **dict() :** This function is used to convert a tuple of order (key,value) into a dictionary.
    10. **str() :** Used to convert integer into a string.
    11. **complex(real,imag) :** This function converts real numbers to complex(real,imag) number.
    - ```py
      # Python code to demonstrate Type conversion
      # using  dict(), complex(), str()

      # initializing integers
      a = 1
      b = 2

      # initializing tuple
      tup = (('a', 1) ,('f', 2), ('g', 3))

      # printing integer converting to complex number
      c = complex(1,2)
      print ("After converting integer to complex number : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing integer converting to string
      c = str(a)
      print ("After converting integer to string : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # printing tuple converting to expression dictionary
      c = dict(tup)
      print ("After converting tuple to dictionary : ",end="")
      print (c)

      # OUTPUT
      # --------------------------------------------
      # After converting integer to complex number : (1+2j)
      # After converting integer to string : 1
      # After converting tuple to dictionary : {'a': 1, 'f': 2, 'g': 3}
      ```
    12. **chr(number):** This function converts number to its corresponding ASCII character. 
    - ```py
      # Convert ASCII value to characters
      a = chr(76)
      b = chr(77)

      print(a)    # L
      print(b)    # M
      ```

## __main__ function (A special variable)

- Since there is **no** `main()` function in Python, when the command to run a python program is given to the interpreter, the code that is at level 0 indentation is to be executed.
- However, before doing that, it will define a few special variables. `__name__` is one such special variable.
- If the source file is executed as the **main program**, the interpreter sets the `__name__` variable to have a value `__main__`.
- If this file is being imported from another module, `__name__` will be set to the module's name.
- `__name__` is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module. Thus it can be used to check whether the current script is being run on its own or being imported somewhere else by combining it with if statement, as shown below.
- ```py
  # File1.py 
  print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 

  if __name__ == "__main__": 
      print ("File1 is being run directly")
  else: 
      print ("File1 is being imported")
  
  # OUPUT
  #--------------
  # File1 __name__ = __main__
  # File1 is being run directly

  #-----------------------------------------------------
  # File2.py 
  import File1 

  print ("File2 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 

  if __name__ == "__main__": 
      print ("File2 is being run directly")
  else: 
      print ("File2 is being imported")
  
  # OUTPUT
  #-------------
  # File1 __name__ = File1
  # File1 is being imported
  # File2 __name__ = __main__
  # File2 is being run directly
  ```
- As seen above, when File1.py is run directly, the interpreter sets the `__name__` variable as `__main__` and when it is run through File2.py by importing, the `__name__` variable is set as the name of the python script, i.e.
- File1. Thus, it can be said that if `__name__ == "__main__"` is the part of the program that runs when the script is run from the command line using a command like python File1.py.
