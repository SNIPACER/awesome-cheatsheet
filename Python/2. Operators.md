# Operators

- OPERATORS: Are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.
- OPERAND: It is the value on which the operator is applied.

## 1. Arithmetic Operators

- Arithmetic operators are used to performing mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

> In **Python 3.x** the result of **division** is a `floating-point`.
> while in **Python 2.x** **division** of 2 integer was an `integer` and to obtain an integer result in `Python 3.x` `floored (//integer)` is used.


| Operator |	Description	| Syntax |
|---|---|---|
| +	 | Addition: adds two operands	| x + y |
| -	 | Subtraction: subtracts two operands	| x - y |
| *	 | Multiplication: multiplies two operands	| x * y |
| /	 | Division (**float**): divides the first operand by the second (2.666666)	| x / y |
| // | Division (**floor**): divides the first operand by the second (2)	| x // y |
| %	 | Modulus: returns the remainder when the first operand is divided by the second	| x % y |
| ** | Power: Returns first raised to power second	| x ** y |

```py
print('x + y --> ',x + y)
print('x - y --> ',x - y)
print('x * y --> ',x * y)
print('x / y --> ',x / y)
print('x // y --> ',x // y)
print('x % y --> ',x % y)
print('x ** y --> ',x ** y)
```
> python follow **BODMAS** rule.

## 2. Comparison Operators

- Comparison of [Relational operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/relational-operators-in-python/) compares the values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.

| Operator | Description                                 | Syntax  |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| >        | Greater than: True if the left operand is greater than the right | x > y   |
| <        | Less than: True if the left operand is less than the right       | x < y   |
| ==       | Equal to: True if both operands are equal                      | x == y  |
| !=       | Not equal to: True if operands are not equal                    | x != y  |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to: True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right | x >= y |
| <=       | Less than or equal to: True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right   | x <= y |
| is       | x is the same as y                                             | x is y  |
| is not   | x is not the same as y                                         | x is not y |

```py
# Examples of Relational Operators
a = 13
b = 33

# a > b is False
print(a > b)

# a < b is True
print(a < b)

# a == b is False
print(a == b)

# a != b is True
print(a != b)

# a >= b is False
print(a >= b)

# a <= b is True
print(a <= b)
```


## 3. Logical Operators

- [Logical operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-logical-operators-with-examples-improvement-needed/) perform **Logical AND**, **Logical OR**, and **Logical NOT** operations. It is used to combine conditional statements.

| Operator | Description                                       | Syntax   |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|----------|
| and      | Logical AND: True if both the operands are true   | x and y  |
| or       | Logical OR: True if either of the operands is true | x or y  |
| not      | Logical NOT: True if the operand is false         | not x    |


```py
# Examples of Logical Operator
a = True
b = False

# Print a and b is False
print(a and b)

# Print a or b is True
print(a or b)

# Print not a is False
print(not a)
```

## 4. Bitwise Operators

- [Bitwise operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-bitwise-operators/) act on bits and perform the bit-by-bit operations. These are used to operate on binary numbers.

| Operator | Description         | Syntax   |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| &        | Bitwise AND         | x & y    |
| \|       | Bitwise OR          | x \| y   |
| ~        | Bitwise NOT         | ~x       |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR         | x ^ y    |
| >>       | Bitwise right shift | x >> y   |
| <<       | Bitwise left shift  | x << y   |


```py
# Examples of Bitwise operators
a = 10
b = 4

# Print bitwise AND operation
print(a & b)

# Print bitwise OR operation
print(a | b)

# Print bitwise NOT operation
print(~a)

# print bitwise XOR operation
print(a ^ b)

# print bitwise right shift operation
print(a >> 2)

# print bitwise left shift operation
print(a << 2)


# OUTPUT
# --------------
# 0
# 14
# -11
# 14
# 2
# 40
```

## 5. Assignment Operators 

- [Assignment operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/assignment-operators-in-python/) are used to assign values to the variables.

| Operator | Description                                                                          | Syntax              |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| =        | Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand                        | x = y + z           |
| +=       | Add AND: Add right-side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand | a += b (a = a + b)  |
| -=       | Subtract AND: Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand | a -= b (a = a - b)  |
| *=       | Multiply AND: Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand | a *= b (a = a * b)  |
| /=       | Divide AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand   | a /= b (a = a / b)  |
| %=       | Modulus AND: Takes modulus using left and right operands and assign the result to left operand | a %= b (a = a % b)  |
| //=      | Divide(floor) AND: Divide left operand with right operand and then assign the value(floor) to left operand | a //= b (a = a // b) |
| **=      | Exponent AND: Calculate exponent (raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand | a **= b (a = a ** b) |
| &=       | Performs Bitwise AND on operands and assign value to left operand                    | a &= b (a = a & b)  |
| \|=      | Performs Bitwise OR on operands and assign value to left operand                     | a \|= b (a = a \| b) |
| ^=       | Performs Bitwise XOR on operands and assign value to left operand                    | a ^= b (a = a ^ b)  |
| >>=      | Performs Bitwise right shift on operands and assign value to left operand            | a >>= b (a = a >> b) |
| <<=      | Performs Bitwise left shift on operands and assign value to left operand             | a <<= b (a = a << b) |


```py
# Examples of Assignment Operators
a = 10

# Assign value
b = a
print(b)

# Add and assign value
b += a
print(b)

# Subtract and assign value
b -= a
print(b)

# multiply and assign
b *= a
print(b)

# bitwise lishift operator
b <<= a
print(b)


# Output
# 10
# 20
# 10
# 100
# 102400
```

## 6. Identity Operators

- **is** and **is not** are the identity operators both are used **to check** if two values are **located** on the **same** part of the **memory**.
- Two variables that are equal do not imply that they are identical.

```console
is          True if the operands are identical 
is not      True if the operands are not identical
```

```py
a = 10
b = 20
c = a
d = 10

print(a is not b)  # True
print(a is c)      # True
print(a is d)      # True
```

## 7. Membership Operators

- **in** and **not** in are the membership operators; used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence.

```
in            True if value is found in the sequence
not in        True if value is not found in the sequence
```

```py
# Python program to illustrate
# not 'in' operator
x = 24
y = 20
list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

if (x not in list):
    print("x is NOT present in given list")
else:
    print("x is present in given list")

if (y in list):
    print("y is present in given list")
else:
    print("y is NOT present in given list")

# Output
#--------------
# x is NOT present in given list
# y is present in given list
```
## 8. Operator Precedence

In Python, operator precedence and associativity determine the order in which parts of an expression are evaluated. Understanding these concepts can help you write and read complex expressions correctly.


Operator precedence is a set of rules that define the order in which different operations are performed in an expression. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence.

For example:
```python
result = 2 + 3 * 4  # Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+)
print(result)  # Output: 14
```

In this expression, `3 * 4` is evaluated first, resulting in `12`, and then `2 + 12` is evaluated, resulting in `14`.

### Operator Associativity

When operators of the same precedence appear in an expression, associativity determines the order in which the operations are performed. Associativity can be either left-to-right or right-to-left.

- **Left-to-right associativity**: Most operators, including arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) and comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`), are left-to-right associative.
- **Right-to-left associativity**: Some operators, like the exponentiation operator (`**`) and assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`), are right-to-left associative.

For example:
```python
result = 2 ** 3 ** 2  # Exponentiation (**) is right-to-left associative
print(result)  # Output: 512
```

In this expression, `3 ** 2` is evaluated first (resulting in `9`), and then `2 ** 9` is evaluated, resulting in `512`.

### Examples of Precedence and Associativity

Here is a list of some common operators in Python, sorted by precedence from highest to lowest, along with their associativity:

1. **Exponentiation**: `**` (right-to-left)
2. **Unary plus, minus, and bitwise NOT**: `+x`, `-x`, `~x` (right-to-left)
3. **Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus**: `*`, `/`, `//`, `%` (left-to-right)
4. **Addition and subtraction**: `+`, `-` (left-to-right)
5. **Bitwise shifts**: `<<`, `>>` (left-to-right)
6. **Bitwise AND**: `&` (left-to-right)
7. **Bitwise XOR**: `^` (left-to-right)
8. **Bitwise OR**: `|` (left-to-right)
9. **Comparison operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `is`, `is not`, `in`, `not in` (left-to-right)
10. **Logical NOT**: `not` (right-to-left)
11. **Logical AND**: `and` (left-to-right)
12. **Logical OR**: `or` (left-to-right)
13. **Conditional expressions**: `if else` (right-to-left)
14. **Assignment operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `//=`, `**=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `>>=`, `<<=` (right-to-left)
15. **Lambda expressions**: `lambda` (right-to-left)

### Examples to Illustrate Precedence and Associativity

1. **Multiplication before Addition**:
    ```python
    result = 2 + 3 * 4
    print(result)  # Output: 14
    ```

2. **Using Parentheses to Change Precedence**:
    ```python
    result = (2 + 3) * 4
    print(result)  # Output: 20
    ```

3. **Exponentiation Associativity**:
    ```python
    result = 2 ** 3 ** 2
    print(result)  # Output: 512
    ```

4. **Mixed Operators**:
    ```python
    result = 5 + 4 * 2 / 2 - 3
    print(result)  # Output: 6.0
    ```

    Explanation:
    - `4 * 2` is evaluated first (resulting in `8`)
    - `8 / 2` is evaluated next (resulting in `4.0`)
    - `5 + 4.0` is evaluated next (resulting in `9.0`)
    - `9.0 - 3` is evaluated last (resulting in `6.0`)

### Key Takeaways

- **Operator precedence** determines the order of operations.
- **Associativity** determines the order of operations when operators have the same precedence.
- **Parentheses** can be used to change the order of operations.

## 9. Ternary operators

- Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.
- It simply allows testing a condition in a single line replacing the multiline if-else making the code compact.


```
Syntax : 

[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false] 
```

```py
# Program to demonstrate conditional operator
a, b = 10, 20

# Copy value of a in min if a < b else copy b
min = a if a < b else b

print(min) # 10

# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Python program to demonstrate ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20

# Use tuple for selecting an item
# (if_test_false,if_test_true)[test]
# if [a<b] is true it return 1, so element with 1 index will print
# else if [a<b] is false it return 0, so element with 0 index will print
print( (b, a) [a < b] )

# Use Dictionary for selecting an item
# if [a < b] is true then value of True key will print
# else if [a<b] is false then value of False key will print 
print({True: a, False: b} [a < b])

# lambda is more efficient than above two methods
# because in lambda  we are assure that
# only one expression will be evaluated unlike in
# tuple and Dictionary
print((lambda: b, lambda: a)[a < b]())

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Ternary operator can be written as nested if-else:
# Python program to demonstrate nested ternary operator
a, b = 10, 20

print ("Both a and b are equal" if a == b else "a is greater than b"
        if a > b else "b is greater than a")
# OUTPUT 
# b is greater than a

# above approach can be written as
a, b = 10, 20

if a != b:
    if a > b:
        print("a is greater than b")
    else:
        print("b is greater than a")
else:
    print("Both a and b are equal")

```

**To use print function in ternary operator be like:-**
- Example: Find the Larger number among 2 using ternary operator in python3
- ```py
  a=5
  b=7

  # [statement_on_True] if [condition] else [statement_on_false] 

  print(a,"is greater") if (a>b) else print(b,"is Greater")
  ```


**Important Points:**
- First the given condition is evaluated (a < b), then either a or b is returned based on the Boolean value returned by the condition
- Order of the arguments in the operator is different from other languages like C/C++ (See C/C++ ternary operators).
- Conditional expressions have the lowest priority amongst all Python operations.


```py
    
# Program to demonstrate conditional operator
a, b = 10, 20

# If a is less than b, then a is assigned
# else b is assigned (Note : it doesn't 
# work if a is 0.
min = a < b and a or b

print(min)      # 10
```

## Difference b/w == and is operator

The Equality operator (==) is a comparison operator in Python that compare values of both the operands and checks for value equality. Whereas the 'is' operator is the  identity operator that checks whether both the operands refer to the same object or not (present in the same memory location).

Illustration:
 

# Equality operator
>>> a=10
>>>b=10
>>>a==b
True

>>>a=10     
>>>id(a)
2813000247664   

>>>b=10
2813000247664    # Both a and b is pointing to the same object

>>>a is b
True

>>>c=a       # Here variable a is assigned to new variable c, which holds same object and same memory location

>>> id(c)
2813000247664

>>>a is c     
True
Example 1:

```py
# python3 code to 
# illustrate the 
# difference between
# == and is operator
# [] is an empty list
list1 = []
list2 = []
list3=list1

if (list1 == list2):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

if (list1 is list2):
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")

if (list1 is list3):
    print("True")
else:    
    print("False")

list3 = list3 + list2

if (list1 is list3):
    print("True")
else:    
    print("False")
```

```console
Output: 

True
False
True
False
    The output of the first if the condition is "True" as both list1 and list2 are empty lists.
    Second, if the condition shows "False" because two empty lists are at different memory locations. Hence list1 and list2 refer to different objects. We can check it with id() function in python which returns the “identity” of an object.
    The output of the third if the condition is "True" as both list1 and list3 are pointing to the same object.
    The output of the fourth if the condition is "False" because the concatenation of two lists always produces a new list.
```

```py
list1 = []
list2 = []

print(id(list1))
print(id(list2))

# OUTPUT
#-----------
# 139877155242696
# 139877155253640
```
