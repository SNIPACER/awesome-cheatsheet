# Functions

- We can create a Python function using the `def` keyword.

```py
def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
	return expression
```

## Calling a funciton

- After creating a function we can call it by using the name of the function followed by parenthesis containing parameters of that particular function.
	- ```py
		# A simple Python function
		def fun():
			print("Welcome to GFG")

		# Driver code to call a function
		fun()

		# OUTPUT
		# Welcome to GFG
		```

## Arguments of a Function

- Arguments are the values passed inside the parenthesis of the function. A function can have any number of arguments separated by a comma.
	-	```py
		# A simple Python function to check
		# whether x is even or odd
		def evenOdd(x):
			if (x % 2 == 0):
				print("even")
			else:
				print("odd")


		# Driver code to call the function
		evenOdd(2)
		evenOdd(3)

		# OUTPUT
		# even
		# odd
		```

### Types of Arguments
Python supports various types of arguments that can be passed at the time of the function call. Let’s discuss each type in detail.

#### **Default arguments**
  
- A default argument is a parameter that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument. The following example illustrates Default arguments. 
  - ```py 
		# Python program to demonstrate
		# default arguments
		def myFun(x, y=50):
			print("x: ", x)
			print("y: ", y)

		# Driver code (We call myFun() with only
		# argument)
		myFun(10)

		# OUTPUT
		# x:  10
		# y:  50
		```

#### **Keyword arguments**

- The idea is to allow the caller to specify the argument name with values so that caller does not need to remember the order of parameters.
  - ```py
		# Python program to demonstrate Keyword Arguments
		def student(firstname, lastname):
			print(firstname, lastname)

		# Keyword arguments
		student(firstname='Geeks', lastname='Practice')
		student(lastname='Practice', firstname='Geeks')

		# OUTPUT
		# Geeks Practice
		# Geeks Practice
		```

#### **Variable-length arguments**

- In Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:

1. ***args (Non-Keyword Arguments)**
2. **\*\*kwargs (Keyword Arguments)**

##### **Example 1:** Variable length non-keywords argument

- ```py
	# Python program to illustrate
	# *args for variable number of arguments
	def myFun(*argv):
		for arg in argv:
			print(arg)

	myFun('Hello', 'Welcome', 'to', 'GeeksforGeeks')

	# OUTPUT
	# Hello
	# Welcome
	# to
	# GeeksforGeeks
	```

##### **Example 2:** Variable length keyword arguments

- ```py
	# Python program to illustrate
	# *kwargs for variable number of keyword arguments
	def myFun(**kwargs):
		for key, value in kwargs.items():
			print("%s == %s" % (key, value))

	# Driver code
	myFun(first='Geeks', mid='for', last='Geeks')

	"""
	OUTPUT
	first == Geeks
	mid == for
	last == Geeks
	"""
	```

##### Docstring
The first string after the function is called the Document string or Docstring in short. This is used to describe the functionality of the function. The use of docstring in functions is optional but it is considered a good practice.

The below syntax can be used to print out the docstring of a function:

Syntax: `print(function_name.__doc__)`

Example: Adding Docstring to the 

```py
# A simple Python function to check
# whether x is even or odd
def evenOdd(x):
	"""Function to check if the number is even or odd"""
	if (x % 2 == 0):
		print("even")
	else:
		print("odd")

# Driver code to call the function
print(evenOdd.__doc__)

# OUTPUT
# Function to check if the number is even or odd
```


##### The return statement
The function return statement is used to exit from a function and go back to the function caller and return the specified value or data item to the caller.

Syntax: `return [expression_list]`

```PY
def square_value(num):
	"""This function returns the square value of the entered number"""
	return num**2

print(square_value(2))
print(square_value(-4))

"""
Output
4
16
"""
```

##### Anonymous functions: 

- An anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know the def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.

```py
# Python code to illustrate the cube of a number
# using lambda function


def cube(x): return x*x*x

cube_v2 = lambda x : x*x*x

print(cube(7))
print(cube_v2(7))

"""
Output
343
343
"""
```

## Yield Function

- **Yield** is a keyword in Python that is used to return from a function without destroying the states of its local variable and when the function is called, the execution starts from the last yield statement.
- Any function that contains a yield keyword is termed a generator. Hence, yield is what makes a generator. The yield keyword in Python is less known off but has a greater utility which one can think of.

### Code #1 : Demonstrating yield working 

```py
# Python3 code to demonstrate
# yield keyword

# generator to print even numbers
def print_even(test_list) :
    for i in test_list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

# initializing list
test_list = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# printing initial list
print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

# printing even numbers
print ("The even numbers in list are : ", end = " ")
for j in print_even(test_list):
    print (j, end = " ")
# Python3 code to demonstrate
# yield keyword

# generator to print even numbers
def print_even(test_list) :
    for i in test_list:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i

# initializing list
test_list = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# printing initial list
print ("The original list is : " + str(test_list))

# printing even numbers
print ("The even numbers in list are : ", end = " ")
for j in print_even(test_list):
    print (j, end = " ")


"""
OUTPUT
The original list is : [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]
The even numbers in list are :  4 6 
"""
```


### Code #2: 

```py
# A Python program to generate squares from 1
# to 100 using yield and therefore generator

# An infinite generator function that prints
# next square number. It starts with 1
def nextSquare():
    i = 1

# An Infinite loop to generate squares
    while True:
        yield i*i
        i += 1 # Next execution resumes
# from this point

# Driver code
for num in nextSquare():
    if num > 100:
        break
    print(num)

"""
Output
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
"""
```


### Advantages of yield: 

- Since it stores the local variable states, hence overhead of memory allocation is controlled.
- Since the old state is retained, the flow doesn’t start from the beginning and hence saves time.

### Disadvantages of yield: 

- Sometimes, the use of yield becomes erroneous if the calling of function is not handled properly.
- Time and memory optimization has a cost of complexity of code and hence sometimes hard to understand the logic behind it.

### Practical Applications: 

- The possible practical application is that when handling the last amount of data and searching particulars from it, yield can be used as we don’t need to look up again from start and hence would save time.
- There can possibly be many applications of yield depending upon the use cases. 


```py
# Python3 code to demonstrate yield keyword

# Checking number of occurrence of
# geeks in string

# generator to print even numbers
def print_even(test_string) :
    for i in test_string:
        if i == "geeks":
            yield i

# initializing string
test_string = " The are many geeks around you, \
geeks are known for teaching other geeks"

# printing even numbers using yield
count = 0
print ("The number of geeks in string is : ", end = "" )
test_string = test_string.split()

for j in print_even(test_string):
    count = count + 1

print (count)


"""
Output
The number of geeks in string is : 3
"""
```


# Python Modules

- A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
- A module can define functions, classes, and variables.
- A module can also include runnable code.
- Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.
- It also makes the code logically organized.

**Example: create a simple module**

```py
# A simple module, calc.py

def add(x, y):
return (x+y)

def subtract(x, y):
return (x-y)
```

## Import Module in Python – Import statement

- We can import the functions, classes defined in a module to another module using the import statement in some other Python source file.

**Syntax:**
```py
import module
```
