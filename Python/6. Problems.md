# Problems

You are familiar with basics of input/output and many other useful things in Python. This module is all about conditional statements like if, elif, else; for, while, etc.

In Python, any conditional statement ends with ':' (proper indentation must be followed while working through loops).

## 1. Two freinds

- There are two friends, **John** and **Smith**, and the parameters `j_angry` and `s_angry` to indicate if each is angry. You are in trouble if both of them are angry or no one of them is angry. 
- Now, complete the function which returns `true` if you are in trouble, else return `false`

```
Input:
j_angry = True, s_angry = True
Output:
True
Explanation:
Since both of them are angry,
so you are in trouble.
```

- ```py
  def friends_in_trouble(j_angry, s_angry):
    if j_angry and s_angry:
        return True
    elif not j_angry  and not s_angry:
        return True
    else:
        return False
  ```

## 2. Mark Even and Odd - Python

Given a positive integer x. Your task is to check, if it is even or odd (Any number that gives zero as remainder when divided by 2 is an even number)

```
Input: x = 4
Output: Even
Input: x = 5
Output: Odd
```
- ```py
  def checkOddEven(x):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
  ```


### Check status

Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.
Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return false.

```
Input:
a = 1
b = -1
flag = False
Output:
True
Explanation:
Since a and b are positive and 
negative respectively and flag
is False, so return True.
```

```py
def check_status(a, b, flag):
    ##Your code here
    ##Either True or False is returned
    if a < 0 or b < 0:
        if(flag is False and (a > 0 or b > 0)):
            return True
        elif flag is True and (a < 0 and b < 0):
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
```

### For loop - Python

Writing for loop in Python is a tad different from C++ and Java counterparts. In this question, we'll learn to print table by using the for loop.

You are given a number N, you need to print its multiplication table.

Note: Please go through the range function to understand why it's useful in for loops.

Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 5
Output:
5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50

```
Example 2:
```
Input:
N = 6
Output:
6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take input of testcases. Just complete the function multiplicationTable() that takes N as input.
```

```py
def multiplicationTable(N):## in is a membership operator that is true if something is a member of sequence
    for i in range(1,11): ## i in range(x,y,z) means i goes from x to y-1 and increments z steps in each iteration
        print(i * N, end=" ") ## Separating by spaces using end =" "
```

### For Loop 2 - python

Welcome to the part 2 of For Loops in Python. In this question, we'll learn to print characters of a string at even indices.

You are given a string str, you need to print its characters at even indices(index starts at 0).

Note: Please go through the range function to understand how to jump 2 steps.

```
Example 1:
Input:
str = DoctorPhenomenal
Output:
DcoPeoea
```
```
Example 2:
Input:
str = Geeks
Output:
Ges
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take input. Just complete the function stringJumper() that takes str as input.
```

```py
def stringJumper(str):
    for i in range(0,len(str),2): ## from 0 to length of str and skip 2
        print(str[i], end="") ##printing character and separating characters by nothing
```

### While loop

You are one more step close to Python Programming World. You are now familiar with if-elif-else in Python, and for loop in Python.

While loop in Python is same as like in CPP and Java, but, here you have to use ':' to end while statement (used to end any statement). While loop is used to iterate same as for loop, except that in while loop you can customize jump of steps in coupling with variable used to loop, after every iteration, unlike in for loop (you cannot customize jump according to the variable you are using to loop through).

Let's get it more clearly through this question. Given a number x, the task is to print the numbers from x to 0 in decreasing order in a single line.

```
Example:
Input:
x = 3
Output:
3 2 1 0
Explanation:
Numbers in decreasing order from 3
are 3, 2, 1, 0.
```

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the printInDecreasing() function and print the x from x to 0 in a single line.

```py
def printInDecreasing(x):
    # Complete the code below
    while(x >= 0):
        
        # your statement below to print the number
        # in decreasing order
        # Note: use end=" " parameter with print to seperate numbers by space.
        ##Output for testcases will automatically separated by a new line by the print() in driver code
        print(x, end=" ")

        x -= 1
```

### Jumping through While - Python

Now you are familiar with While loop in Python. Let's get deeper into understanding it through below question.

Given a positive integer x, the task is to print the numbers from 1 to x in the order as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, ... (in increasing order).

Example:

Input:
x = 10
Output:
1 4 9
Explanation:
From 1 to 10, numbers in powers
of 2 are, 12, 22, 32 as 1, 4 and 9.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the function printIncreasingPower().

Constraints:
2 <= x <= 103

```py
def printIncreasingPower(x):
    ##Your code here
    count = 1
    # Loop to jump in powers of 2
    while(count ** 2 <= x):
        ##Your code here
        
        print ( count ** 2, end = " ")
        count +=1
```

### Zero Converter - Python

You are given a number n. The number n can be negative or positive. If n is negative, print numbers from n to 0 by adding 1 to n in the neg function. If positive, print numbers from n-1 to 0 by subtracting 1 from n in the pos function.

Note:- You don't have to return anything, you just have to print the array.

```
Example 1:
Input:
n = 0
Output:
already Zero
```
```
Example 2:
Input:
n = 4
Output:
3 2 1 0
```
```
Example 3:
Input:
n = -3
Output:
-3 -2 -1 0
```

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take input of test cases. Just complete the functions pos() and neg().

```py
def pos(n):
    ## Write the code
    while True:
        n-=1
        if(n < 0):
            break
        print(n, end=" ")
def neg(n):
    ##Write the code
     while True:
        if(n > 0):
            break
        print(n, end=" ")
        n+=1
```

### Cat and Hat

You are given a string str, you need to return True if  the words "cat" and "hat" appear same number of times in str, otherwise return False.
Note: str contains only lowercase English alphabets.

Example 1:

Input:
str = catinahat
Output:
True
Explanation:
cat and hat both are present
1 number of times.
Example 2:

Input:
str = bazingaa
Output:
True
Explanation:
cat and hat both are present
0 number of times.
Constraints:
1 <= str.size() <= 105
