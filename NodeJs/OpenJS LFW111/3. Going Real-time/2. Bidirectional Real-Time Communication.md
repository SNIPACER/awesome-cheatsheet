# Bidirectional Real-Time Communication

- **WebSocket Connection Handling**:
  - Currently, every time a user selects a different category or adds an item, the existing WebSocket connection is closed, and a new connection is established. This process can cause a flicker in the web app as order numbers temporarily show as pending during WebSocket reconnection.

- **Optimal Client-Side Behavior**:
  - For production-ready client applications, it's beneficial to implement more optimal strategies for handling state changes and WebSocket connections.
  - Ideally, the client should manage state transitions more seamlessly, possibly by maintaining the WebSocket connection across category changes or by handling state transitions in a smoother manner to minimize disruption.

- **Server-side Support for Optimal Behavior**:
  - To support these optimizations, the server-side mock service can be enhanced to better mimic optimal client-side behavior during state transitions.
  - This could involve maintaining WebSocket connections for longer durations, handling state changes more gracefully, and ensuring smoother transitions between different categories or states.

- **Deployment Considerations**:
  - When deploying a client-side application with real-time features, ensuring robust WebSocket management and state handling is crucial for providing a smooth user experience.
  - Implementing these optimizations can enhance the usability and performance of the application, reducing disruptions during user interactions.

- Let's update the client-side `realtimeOrders` function (along with the socket variable just above it) in `static/app.js` to the following:
    - ```js
      let socket = null;
      // Realtime orders via Websocket
      const realtimeOrders = (category) => {
        if (socket === null) {
          socket = new WebSocket(`${WS_API}/orders/${category}`);
        } else {
          socket.send(
            // Send update-category command to server
            JSON.stringify({ cmd: "update-category", payload: { category } })
          );
        }
        // Listen for messages
        socket.addEventListener("message", ({ data }) => {
          try {
            const { id, total } = JSON.parse(data);
            const item = document.querySelector(`[data-id="${id}"]`);
            if (item === null) return;
            const span =
              item.querySelector('[slot="orders"]') || document.createElement("span");
            span.slot = "orders";
            span.textContent = total;
            item.appendChild(span);
          } catch (err) {
            console.error(err);
          }
        });
      };
      ```

- **Single WebSocket Connection**: 
  - The application now maintains a single WebSocket connection throughout its lifecycle.
  - This approach contrasts with previous behavior where connections were closed and reopened on category changes or item additions.

- **Client-Side Handling**:
  - The client-side code currently focuses on understanding server-side interactions and is kept minimal for learning purposes.
  - In a production scenario, it would include robust socket reconnection logic to handle network interruptions and maintain seamless real-time communication.

- **WebSocket Initialization**: 
  - When a category is first selected in the web app, a WebSocket connection is established to an endpoint corresponding to that category.
  - Subsequent category selections involve sending a stringified object over the WebSocket with a `cmd` property set to 'update-category' and a `payload` property containing the newly selected category.

- Now we need to update our server to support this. Let's update the `mock-srv/routes/orders/index.mjs` file to the following code:

    - ```js
      "use strict";
      export default async function (fastify, opts) {
        function monitorMessages(socket) {
          socket.on("message", (data) => {
            try {
              const { cmd, payload } = JSON.parse(data);
              if (cmd === "update-category") {
                sendCurrentOrders(payload.category, socket);
              }
            } catch (err) {
              fastify.log.warn(
                "WebSocket Message (data: %o) Error: %s",
                data,
                err.message
              );
            }
          });
        }

        function sendCurrentOrders(category, socket) {
          for (const order of fastify.currentOrders(category)) {
            socket.send(order);
          }
        }

        fastify.get(
          "/:category",
          { websocket: true },
          async ({ socket }, request) => {
            monitorMessages(socket);
            sendCurrentOrders(request.params.category, socket);
            for await (const order of fastify.realtimeOrders()) {
              if (socket.readyState >= socket.CLOSING) break;
              socket.send(order);
            }
          }
        );
      }
      ```

1. **Functions Added:**
   - **sendCurrentOrders**: Refactors the logic from the route handler function to send current orders over WebSocket. It's used in both the route handler and `monitorMessages` function.
   - **monitorMessages**: Accepts a socket instance and attaches a message listener. When the client sends data via WebSocket (`send` method), it parses incoming JSON data. If `cmd` is 'update-category', it calls `sendCurrentOrders` with `payload.category`. Error handling with `JSON.parse` and logging using Fastify's logger is implemented.

2. **Operation Flow:**
   - **Server Start**: Begin the server using `npm run dev` and serve static assets with `npm run static`.
   - **Client Interaction**: Access the web app at http://localhost:5050. Selecting categories or adding products triggers WebSocket updates.
   - **Functionality**: Orders are updated in real-time based on user actions. The client-side experience may show a slight flicker due to WebSocket reconnections, which could be optimized in a production-ready client.

3. **Future Enhancements**: Discusses potential improvements for a more seamless client-side experience and highlights the flexibility of bidirectional communication for various real-time updates beyond category switching.
